# ⭐ GitHub Star Aggregator

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jia-seed/github-star-aggregator?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/jia-seed/github-star-aggregator)

A simple GitHub Action that counts the total stars across your pinned (or any) repositories and displays a live-updating badge on your GitHub profile README.

**Example on my profile:** [github.com/jia-seed](https://github.com/jia-seed)

![Total Stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/total__stars-196-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

## How It Works

A GitHub Action runs every 6 hours (or on demand), queries the GitHub API for star counts on your specified repos, sums them up, and updates a badge in your profile README automatically.

## Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create your profile repo (skip if you already have one)

Your profile README lives in a repo named the same as your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `octocat`, create a repo called `octocat` with a `README.md` file.

### 2. Add the badge to your README

Paste this line wherever you want the badge to appear in your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![Total Stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/total__stars-0-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/jia-seed/github-star-aggregator)
```

This wraps the badge in a link to this repo, so anyone who clicks it can see how to set it up for themselves. If you don't want the link, just use the image without the outer brackets:

```markdown
![Total Stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/total__stars-0-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)
```

> **Important:** Shields.io uses `-` as a separator and `_` as a space. To display a literal underscore, use `__` (double underscore). This is why the URL has `total__stars` and not `total_stars`.

Make sure the badge is on its own line with a blank line before and after it, or GitHub won't render it as an image.

### 3. Add the workflow file

Create the file `.github/workflows/update-stars.yml` in your profile repo with the following contents:

```yaml
name: Update Total Stars

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # every 6 hours
  workflow_dispatch:  # manual trigger

jobs:
  update-stars:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Count stars and update README
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const fs = require('fs');

            // ADD YOUR REPOS HERE
            // format: { owner: 'github-username-or-org', repo: 'repo-name' }
            const repos = [
              { owner: 'YOUR_USERNAME', repo: 'your-repo-1' },
              { owner: 'YOUR_USERNAME', repo: 'your-repo-2' },
              // add as many as you want
            ];

            let totalStars = 0;

            for (const { owner, repo } of repos) {
              try {
                const { data } = await github.rest.repos.get({ owner, repo });
                totalStars += data.stargazers_count;
                console.log(`${owner}/${repo}: ${data.stargazers_count} ⭐`);
              } catch (e) {
                console.log(`failed to fetch ${owner}/${repo}: ${e.message}`);
              }
            }

            console.log(`\ntotal: ${totalStars} ⭐`);

            let readme = fs.readFileSync('README.md', 'utf8');

            readme = readme.replace(
              /!\[Total Stars\]\(https:\/\/img\.shields\.io\/badge\/total__stars-\d+-yellow\?style=for-the-badge&logo=github\)/,
              `![Total Stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/total__stars-${totalStars}-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)`
            );

            fs.writeFileSync('README.md', readme);

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git diff --quiet || (git add README.md && git commit -m "update total stars count" && git push)
```

### 4. Enable workflow write permissions

Go to your profile repo's **Settings > Actions > General**, scroll to **Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**, and save.

### 5. Run it

Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo, click **Update Total Stars** in the sidebar, then click **Run workflow**. The badge will update within a few seconds.

After the first run, the action will automatically run every 6 hours to keep your star count current.

## Customization

### Badge style

Change the badge appearance by modifying the shields.io URL in the workflow:

| Style | URL snippet |
|-------|------------|
| Default (flat) | `?style=flat` |
| For the badge | `?style=for-the-badge` |
| Flat square | `?style=flat-square` |
| Plastic | `?style=plastic` |

### Badge color

Replace `yellow` in the URL with any color:

```
https://img.shields.io/badge/total_stars-100-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github
```

Options: `brightgreen`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `red`, `blue`, `lightgrey`, or any hex code like `ff69b4`.

### Include all public repos instead of specific ones

Replace the `repos` array section in the workflow with:

```javascript
// fetch all public repos for a user
const allRepos = await github.paginate(github.rest.repos.listForUser, {
  username: 'YOUR_USERNAME',
  type: 'public',
  per_page: 100,
});

let totalStars = 0;
for (const repo of allRepos) {
  totalStars += repo.stargazers_count;
}
console.log(`total across ${allRepos.length} repos: ${totalStars} ⭐`);
```

### Update frequency

Change the cron schedule in the workflow:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 */12 * * *'  # every 12 hours
  - cron: '0 0 * * *'     # once a day at midnight
  - cron: '0 0 * * 1'     # once a week on monday
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Badge shows as raw text, not an image | Make sure the badge is on its own line with blank lines before and after it. Remove any HTML comments directly touching the markdown |
| Badge label shows spaces instead of underscores | Use `__` (double underscore) in the shields.io URL. Single `_` renders as a space |
| Action fails with `Permission denied` | Enable **Read and write permissions** in Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions |
| Badge shows `0` | Make sure your repo list in the workflow matches your actual repo names exactly |
| Action doesn't appear in Actions tab | Make sure the `.yml` file is on your default branch (usually `main`) |
| Badge doesn't update | Check the Actions tab for failed runs and review the error logs |

## Example

Here's what it looks like in a profile README (the badge links to this repo so people can set it up themselves):

```markdown
# hey, i'm jia!

[![Instagram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-71k-E4405F?style=for-the-badge&logo=instagram&logoColor=white)](https://instagram.com/jia.seed)

[![Total Stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/total__stars-196-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/jia-seed/github-star-aggregator)

...rest of your readme
```

By wrapping the badge image in a link (`[![...](image-url)](link-url)`), clicking the badge takes people to this repo where they can learn how to set it up for their own profile.
